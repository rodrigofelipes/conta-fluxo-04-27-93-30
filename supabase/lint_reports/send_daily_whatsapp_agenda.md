# Function `public.send_daily_whatsapp_agenda` â€“ Mutable `search_path`

## Issue Summary
- **Problem:** The function does not define a fixed `search_path`, so it inherits whatever `search_path` is active when it runs. This allows name resolution to be hijacked (for example, a malicious table or function in a different schema shadowing an expected object).
- **Impact:** Because the function is `SECURITY DEFINER`, it runs with elevated privileges. A mutable `search_path` lets attackers escalate privileges by invoking unexpected objects.

## Suggested Fixes
1. **Set an explicit search path at the beginning of the function**:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.send_daily_whatsapp_agenda()
   RETURNS jsonb
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   SECURITY DEFINER
   SET search_path = public, pg_temp
   AS $$
   ...
   $$;
   ```
   Include only the schemas that the function actually needs.
2. **Schema-qualify all object references** (e.g., `public.daily_whatsapp_log`, `cron.schedule`) so that even if the `search_path` changes, the function still resolves objects safely.
3. **Review other invocations** of this function (cron jobs or triggers) to ensure they do not depend on an implicit `search_path` and update them to use schema-qualified calls if necessary.

Addressing the mutable `search_path` protects against name resolution attacks and aligns with lint/security best practices.
